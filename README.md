# Share a Thought

A simple social media site where users can share their thoughts and react to those of others.

This application currently lacks a frontend but can be interacted with via the backend API by using software such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest).
The backend consists of an [Express](https://expressjs.com) server using [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to interface with a database.

A walkthrough video of the underlying API can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q-xSEee_4JdKUjyhmvZHgYf8hv2p4CuP/view).
